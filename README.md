# noTLS
This is a beginner iOS app with painful "UI" to demonstrating making an HTTP call with TLS.

## Prerequisistes
Make sure Xcode is installed.

## Install
Clone the project and open the XCode project:

`open No TLS.xcodeproj`

Chose an iPhone Simulator (I build on iPhone 14 Pro running 16.4) and then press play. Click on the Fetch Insecure button to make the HTTP request.
